# Core Level Number Programming – Day 01

This folder contains core-level Java number programming problems practiced as part of daily coding preparation.
This seem small and easy looking at but in every program we use them for logic building this simple logics help us in programming a lot . 
All the programs are written in neat and clean methods . 

## Topics Covered
- Even or Odd Number
- Count of Numbers in a Given Range
- Count of Digits
- Sum of Digits
- Product of Digits
- Reverse of a Number
- Factorial of a Number
- Fibonacci Series
- Prime Number Check
- Cube of a Number

## Objective
The goal of these programs is to strengthen understanding of:
- Basic control flow (if-else, loops)
- Mathematical logic
- Input handling using `Scanner`
- Writing clean and readable Java code

Each problem is implemented as a **separate Java file** for clarity and easy practice.

## Notes
- These are core-level problems focused on fundamentals.
- Code is written for learning and interview preparation.
- Advanced optimizations are intentionally avoided at this stage.
